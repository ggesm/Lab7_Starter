## Check your understanding

1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why. <br>

    Answer: **Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed** because it runs test automatically every time you update the code, helping you catch problems early and keep the project.
   
2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? 
   <br>

   Answer: **No** because end to end tests check the whole app working together, not individual functions. Use unit tests instead to check a functions output.
